This module parses the outputs from VCFTools' various commands:

### Implemented
* `relatedness2`
  * Plots a heatmap of pairwise sample relatedness.
  * Not to be confused with the similarly-named command `relatedness`

### To do
VCFTools has a number of outputs not yet supported in MultiQC which
would be good to add. Please check GitHub if you'd like these added
or (better still), would like to contribute!

* basic stats
* relatedness
* freq
* depth
* [Everything else](https://vcftools.github.io/man_latest.html)
